# Disapearing Polygons!
This has been changed out of curiosity from the actual tutorial video. 
Instead of circles, I am using stars. 
Instead of the same sizes and colors, I am randomly doing size and color.
It is responsive. Meaning if you shrink your screen, or enlarge it, the stars will stay on your screen. 
The color will also change as it disapears.

This was an introduction to paper.js with the challenge to generate circles in line. 
I used stars :D
